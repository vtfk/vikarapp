PS: There are currently some bugs in the templates which makes the api connections not work. 
As a workaround, delete the created connections, open each logic apps, and solve errors manually

1. Sharepoint setup: Open VikarApp-SP-setup-v1.x.ps1. Read description and run the script
2. Logic Apps setup: Open VikarApp-LA-setup-v1.x.ps1. Read description and run the script
3. Open each logic apps and make sure all connections does not have any errors
4. Import PowerApp-VikarApp-v2.x.zip to powerapps
